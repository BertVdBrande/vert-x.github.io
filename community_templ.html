        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>The Vert.x core project is a project of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/">Eclipse Foundation</a>
        The Eclipse <a href="http://eclipse.org/proposals/rt.vertx/">project proposal</a> provides some useful
          background information including a list of interested companies and individuals.</p>
        <p>The core project committers include developers employed by Red Hat and Pivotal Inc., and committers to other
        Vert.x projects include developers from several other companies.</p>
        <p>There is more information on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vert.x">Wikipedia page</a></p>

        <p>Vert.x has a thriving community and includes further contributions by many other individuals and
          organisations</p>

        <h2>The Source</h2>

        <p>The Vert.x source lives at github where the <a href="https://github.com/vert-x/">vert-x</a> organisation is
          the umbrella under which all the Vert.x related projects live.
          This includes the <a href="https://github.com/vert-x/vert.x">core Vert.x project</a>, as well as various
          others such as language implementation modules, the test framework, web-site and others.</p>
        <p>Vert.x is highly modular and the core project is quite compact. Much of the functionality of Vert.x is
          provided in the form of modules - some maintained under the vert-x umbrella but many others created and
          maintained by the community.</p>
